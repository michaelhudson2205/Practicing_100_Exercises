# >>>===Exercise 1===<<<
# Write a sequence of Python instructions to declare 3 variables a,b, and
# c, assigning them the values 1, 'France', and 36.2 respectively, then
# display the values of thes variables on the console.

# >>>===Exercise 2===<<<
# Write a sequence of Python instructions to declare 1 variable ch and
# initialize it with the value 'hello', then modify this same variable to
# contain the value 'how are you'. The program should display the
# content of the variable on the console after modification.

# >>>===Exercise 3===<<<
# Write a sequence of Python instructions to declare 2 variables x and y,
# assigning them the values 3 and 8.5 respectively, then convert the type
# of these variables to strings. The program should display the type of these # variables after conversion at the end.

# >>>===Exercise 5===<<<
# Write a sequence of Python instructions to declare a variable var and
# assign it the value "Hello", then the program should check whether the
# variable var is an integer or a string. If it is an integer, the program
# should display "Interger" on the console. If it is a string, the program

# >>>===Exercise 6===<<<
# Write a program that declares the variable d and assigns it the value 5,
# then checks whether this variable is greater or less than 0. If the
# variable is greater than 0, the program should display 'Positive',
# otherwise, it should display 'Negative'.

# >>>===Exercise 7===<<<
# Write a program that asks the user for their age, then stores it in a
# variable. The program should check whether the user is older or
# younger than 18 years. If the user's age is greater than or equal to 18,
# the program should display "The user is a legal adult", otherwise "The
# user is a minor".

# Request user age

# >>>===Exercise 8===<<<
# Write a Python program that displays the numbers from 1 to
# 20 inclusive on the console. Create two versions, one with
# the for loop and the other with the while loop.

# for loop

# while loop
counter = 1
while counter <= 20:
