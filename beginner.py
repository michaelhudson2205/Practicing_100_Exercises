# ===Exercise 1===
# Write a sequence of Python instructions to declare 3 variables a,b, and
# c, assigning them the values 1, 'France', and 36.2 respectively, then
# display the values of thes variables on the console.
a = 1
b = "France"
c = 36.2
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# ===Exercise 2===
# Write a sequence of Python instructions to declare 1 variable ch and
# initialize it with the value 'hello', then modify this same variable to
# contain the value 'how are you'. The program should display the
# content of the variable on the console after modification.
ch = "hello"
ch = "how are you"
print(ch)

# ===Exercise 3===
# Write a sequence of Python instructions to declare 2 variables x and y,
# assigning them the values 3 and 8.5 respectively, then convert the type
# of these variables to strings.
# The program should display the type of these variables after conversion
# at the end.
x = 3
y = 8.5
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
x = str(x)
y = str(y)
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
